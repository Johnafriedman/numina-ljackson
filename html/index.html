    <h2>Welcome...</h2>
    <p class="maintext">Dear Fellow Rubber Stamp Enthusiasts,<br />
During these    extraordinary times many folks are staying home, including us. That said, we continue to fire up the in-house vulcanizers  to make stamps. As long as the Postal Service delivers, we are shipping  orders promptly while minding the rules of social distancing. Also, we wanted you to know that we now have  PayPal invoicing for secure online payments. <a href="pages/contact.html">Contact us</a> to open the process via email. Once you have written up the particulars of your stamp and supply desires, we can iron out  details and   arrive at your invoice total. Soon your stamps will be on their way. Meanwhile, stay comfortable and safe. May good health and humor be yours for the duration. Slow down, take a deep breath and consider indulging in a trip to the Rubber Zone.</p>

    <h3>Love Letters, Journals,</h3>
    <p class="maintext"> scrapbooks,  cards, social  posts, notes, wordplay and oddball  scribblings await your artfully inspired adornment. The Rubber Zone is nothing other than your own natural, infinitely flexible capacity to visualize, recognize and shape creative opportunities. </p>
    <h3>Manifest Pictorial Zest</h3>
     <p class="maintext"> Tune in to the pictorial play of your own wild mind. Dust off your stamps and relish some quiet time either on your own or with others of your household for a deep dive into uncharted territory on paper. Conjure up outflows of illustrated letters, notes, cards and posts to Dear Ones near and far. Though in-person visits  are on hold for now, your tangible messages will convey kindness and care in this age of  high-speed overwhelm. Share encouraging words. Times are dicey, but this too will pass.</p>
